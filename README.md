Turned complex data into preclinically validated strategies through rigorous biological & mathematical reasoning | Co-Founder, Health x AI | Fundraising | Computational biologist

---
Jiyuan Liu is a passionate, impact-driven computational biologist who **transforms complex data into preclinically validated cancer prevention and treatment, and drives high-confidence, efficient data-to-decision outcomes**, including hypothesis generation, actionable insights, and preclinical validated strategies.<br>

His (co-)first-author publications demonstrate the impact and outcome: Oncogene(2022 and 2025), EMBO Reports(2023), Nature Communications(2025), two manuscripts in preparation. <br>His computational approach and philosophy to deliver preclinically validated strategies:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) seamlessly integrates expertise in computational analysis and bench science;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) applies robust mathematical and biological reasoning;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) leverages single-cell and spatial genomics to discover and prioritize cellular and molecular targets.

He represented his university in the National Mathematical Modeling Contest and is highly proficient in developing and customizing computational infrastructure, including:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) building R packages from scratch;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) debugging and extending open-source tools in R and Python;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) developing and optimizing pipelines for translational R&D. 

Jiyuan has built end-to-end spatial genomics pipelines, covering: sample preparation; sequencing library construction; bioinformatics analysis; publication-ready presentation; preclinical validation.
